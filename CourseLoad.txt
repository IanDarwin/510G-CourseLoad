Application Software:
Course load runs on Windows or Linux (Ubuntu provided by the Lab)
But: Linux Emulator performance under Linux is unacceptable

Dev Tools
	Android Studio IDE (Ch03 to end) - free from Google (it's just JetBrains IntelliJ with extra plugins)
		https://developer.android.com/download - Chipmunk 2021.2.1 
		Had to hand-craft a startup script since IntelliJ STILL CANNOT HACK JAVA > 11!!! Saved in 'scripts'
		Later found could have used winget install --id Google.AndroidStudio
		Did first to see if Emulator worked.
	Android SDK, tools, emulators - downloaded when starting up Studio first time
	Flutter SDK - latest - from https://flutter.dev/
	Flutter plugin for Android Studio - via Studio Settings->Plugins
	Misc Tools:
		git in "git bash" via winget install --id Git.Git -e
		maven build tool, downloaded from https://maven.apache.org/download
	Java JDK 11 LTS - needed for older releases
		winget install --id EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.11
	Java JDK 17 LTS - free from numerous OpenJDK download sites
		winget install --id EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.17
	Eclipse Java IDE (Ch02) - free from Eclipse Software Foundation
		https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ ran installer (annoyingly many steps)
	PATH set to:
		PATH=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.3.7-hotspot\bin
		C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.15.10-hotspot\bin
		C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
		C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
		C:\Users\student\apache-maven-3.8.5\bin

		C:\Users\student\bin
		C:\Users\student\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools\bin
		C:\Users\student\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
		C:\Users\student\flutter\bin
	Put BOTH .../Android/Sdk/tools/bin and ...Android/Sdk/platform-tools on path
	Eg on Windows
		%USERPROFILE%\APpData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools\bin
		%USERPROFILE%\APpData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
