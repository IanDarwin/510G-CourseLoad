= Course Setup for 510G Android

This directory tries to automate the setup as much as possible.

== TO CONFIGURE A STUDENT MACHINE

* In a CMD window, download the script

	cd %USERPROFILE%
	curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanDarwin/510G-CourseLoad/main/setup.ps1

* If the student logs in with a name other than 'student', edit the new file setup.ps1 and change globally, case-insensitively

* In a PowerShell AS ADMIN window, allow running unsigned P/S scripts:

	set-executionpolicy Unrestricted

AND accept the resulting prompt with a Yes.

* In the same window, run the setup

	cd ~
	.\setup.ps1

* Come back when it's done, and complete the "manual steps" shown below.

== Structure

I have configured this for the following overall setup - these will be added
to each student's directory:

* CourseFiles510G - exercises, solutions, samples
* Downloads/... - downloads for installing programs for later chapters
	so the students can learn to set these up
* Pictures/ - one image file used in a do-now
* bin - a few shell scripts/batch files
* lib - a few Java Jar files etc.
* javasrc - extra Java samples that we might refer to in response to questions
* AndroidCookbookExamples - extra Android examples that might be used

== Assumptions

We presume that:

* The students log in as "student" on these machines
* The student machines have Windows 10/11
* The student machines have "winget" installed (it was optional on some early Win10).
* The student machines have the git-bash (MinGW) package installed and on PATH
* The student machines have recent Python 3 installed standardly (so that "pip install" will work).

The setup.ps1 file is a PowerShell script using:

* WinGet to install java, intellij idea, android studio, etc
* git to install CourseFiles510G, javasrc, Android-Cookbook-Examples
* curl to download a few files
* tar to extract bin, lib, Downloads, Maven
* powershell SetPaths.ps1 to set the PATH for some programs that need it

== Manual Steps

The following did not get automated. Please:

* Set the home directory in whatever browser the students are using, to 

	file://Users/Student/CourseFiles510G/web/index.html

== Summary

The Setup1 script will stitch together all the files needed for the course.
